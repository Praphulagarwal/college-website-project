        The department has well qualified and experienced faculty. The programme of this department is designed to meet the present day industry needs. Students learn different mechanism of machines, strength of materials, design of various elements, production process etc. The department has a huge central workshop consisting of Machine shop, smithy shop, Welding shop, Carpentry shop, Fitting shop, sheet metal shop as well as other fully developed labs notably Automobile, CAD / CAM, Fluid Machinery , Refrigeration & Air Conditioning , Heat & Mass Transfer, (HMT) Mechanics of Machines, Material Testing , Applied Thermodynamics , Backed - up by two well equipped Drawing halls .<br><br>
        Mechanical Engineering is synonymous to Industrial Revolution that started after the invention of Steam Engine by James Watt. Wright brothers invented plane that revolutionized aviation industries. It is the industrial revolution that brought prosperity and comforts to the people. From pins to planes including commercial and fighter planes, from simple agricultural equipments khurpies to tractors, from bullock carts to all sorts of modern cars & trains and from simple boats to big ships & submarines are all creations of Mechanical Engineers. All the modern inventions such as rockets, space vehicles, multi-task missiles, battle tanks, sophisticated guns, robots, all types of power plants, air conditioners etc. are all creations of Mechanical Engineers. In every industry, the need of Mechanical Engineers varies from 40% to 80%. Whatever product we choose, whether Mechanical, Electrical or Electronics, a major contribution of Mechanical Engineering is involved. As a result of a large amount of involvement of Mechanical Engineers in various industries and organizations, the branch of Mechanical Engineering is regarded as Ever Green Branch of Engineering.<br><br>
        The faculty actively participates in sponsored research and consultancy work, seminars/conferences and short-term courses. The teaching and research programs in the department are organized according to both disciplinary and inter-disciplinary themes. We cover all the core disciplinary areas of mechanical engineering including dynamics, controls, solid mechanics, materials, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, production and design.<br><br>
