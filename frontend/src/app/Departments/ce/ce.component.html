    Civil Engineering is regarded as the mother of engineering. As per Hindu Methology, Lord Vishwakarma is regarded as the greatest engineer ever borne on the universe. In India, Engineers Day is celebrated on the Birthday of Late Honbï¿½le M. Vesvaraya, the greatest Civil Engineer who built Krishna Raja Sagar Dam. Whatever infrastructure, we see world over, it is the creation of civil Engineers. From small houses to sky scrappers even more than 100 stories with revolving hotels and bars, from simple roads to superhighways, from culverts to long bridges, from simple railway stations to super railway junctions, airports, docks, all monuments, seven wonders of the world, dams, power houses, metros, etc, are all the creations of civil engineers. Some of the great recent achievements of civil engineers are tunnel super expressway underneath the English Channel joining London and Paris, Railway link between Sanghai and Lhasa in which 500 km rail link is on Icy Hill in which liquid nitrogen flows to maintain temperature and recently built sea link in Mumbai, etc. It is an established fact that the infrastructure is the backbone of development and prosperity of a nation.<br>
